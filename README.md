# Travel-taneous

## About the app
For travelers who never know if they have the money to go on a trip until it's too late (flight became too expensive, didn't RSVP on time, etc.) - well no more! They can input how many paychecks they can start saving for the trip and the app calculates the portion that has to come out of each paycheck using the traveler's trip estimate. The traveler can then decide if they can afford to go or decline.

This is also for travelers that want to compare how well they budgeted for the trip. They can compare which categories they went overbudget on and by how much (percentage), so if they see there's a recurring theme, then they can adjust those budget categories for future trips.
